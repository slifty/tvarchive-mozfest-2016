IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT AMERICA'S WORD BE GOOD AND SO I KNOW THAT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS CAUSED SOME QUESTIONING AND SOME WORRIES ON THE PART OF MANY LEADERS ACROSS THE GLOBE. I'VE TALKED WITH A NUMBER OF THEM, BUT I WANT TO, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND I THINK ON BEHALF OF A MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, OUR WORD IS GOOD.

YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE -- THAT'S RIGHT, WITH JAPAN, WITH SAUDI ARABIA. I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE WE'RE DEFENDING SAUDI ARABIA AND WITH ALL OF THE MONEY THEY HAVE, WE'RE DEFENDING THEM AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS FRONT OF A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE, HE CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT STAMINA. >> THE WORLD -- LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS DURING THE LAST -- SO SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE THAT I AGREE, BUT IT'S BAD, BAD EXPERIENCE. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL THAT YOU'RE SO IN LOVE WITH WHERE WE GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL, WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE. >> WE ARE AT THE -- WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION -- >> WELL, ONE THING -- >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD"

TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER.

I WILL FELL YOU THIS, LESTER. IT'S NOT NICE AND I DON'T -- I DON'T DESERVE THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE THING THAT SHE'S DONE.

SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I SUPPORT OUR DEMOCRACY, AND SOMETIMES YOU WIN, SOMETIMES YOU LOSE, BUT I CERTAINLY WILL SUPPORT THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. AND I KNOW DONALD'S TRYING VERY HARD TO PLANT DOUBTS ABOUT IT, BUT I HOPE THE PEOPLE OUT THERE UNDERSTAND THIS ELECTION'S REALLY UP TO YOU. IT'S NOT ABOUT US SO MUCH AS IT IS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES AND THE KIND OF COUNTRY AND FUTURE YOU WANT. SO I SURE HOPE YOU WILL GET OUT AND VOTE AS THOUGH YOUR FUTURE DEPENDED ON IT BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES. >> MR. TRUMP, VERY QUICKLY. THE SAME QUESTION. WILL YOU ACCEPT THE OUTCOME AS THE WILL OF THE VOTERS? >> I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE A NATION THAT IS SERIOUSLY TROUBLED. WE'RE LOSING OUR JOBS. PEOPLE ARE POURING IN TO OUR COUNTRY. THE OTHER DAY WE WERE DEPORTING 800 PEOPLE. PERHAPS THEY PRESSED THE WRONG BUTTON. THEY PRESSED THE WRONG BUTTON. OR PERHAPS WORSE THAN THAT, IT WAS CORRUPTION. BUT THESE PEOPLE THAT WE WERE GOING TO DEPORT, FOR GOOD REASON, ENDED UP BECOMING CITIZENS. ENDED UP BECOMING CITIZENS. AND IT WAS 800 AND NOW IT TURNS OUT IT MIGHT BE 1,800 AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW. >> WILL YOU ACCEPT THE OUTCOME OF THE ZPL ELECTION? >> I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. I DON'T BELIEVE HILLARY WILL. THE ANSWER IS IF SHE WINS, I WILL ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT HER. >> ALL RIGHT. THAT IS GOING TO DO IT FOR US. THAT CONCLUDES OUR DEBATE FOR THIS EVENING. A SPIRITED ONE. WE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND. NOT EVERYTHING. AS I SUSPECTED WE WOULDN'T. WOULD.
