AND AFTER THAT, A NUMBER OF WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD SAYING THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID TO THEM. NOW, WHAT WAS HIS RESPONSE. WELL, HE HELD A NUMBER OF BIG RALLIES WHERE HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE DONE THOSE THINGS TO THOSE WOMEN BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH FOR -- >> DID I NOT SAY THAT. >> IN FACT YOU WENT ON TO SAY -- HER TWO MINUTES, SIR. >> BUT DID NOT SAY THAT. >> HER TWO MINUTES. >> HE WENT ON TO SAY, LOOK AT HER, I DON'T THINK SO.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNING AT RALLIES RECENTLY THAT THIS ELECTION IS RIGGED. AND THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO STEAL IT. YOUR RUNNING MATE PLEDGED ON SUNDAY THAT HE AND YOU, HIS WORDS, WILL ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT THE RESULT OF THIS ELECTION TODAY, YOUR DAUGHTER WE VANG COULD SAID THE SAME THING. I WOULDN'T ASK YOU HERE ON THIS STAGE TONIGHT, DO YOU MAKE THE SAME COMMITMENT THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY, SIR, THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT THE RESULT OF THIS ELECTION. >> I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. I'M NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING NOW. I'LL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. WHAT I'VE SEEN, WHAT I'VE SEEN IS SO BAD. FIRST OF ALL THE MEDIA IS SO DISHONEST AND SO CORRUPT AND PIE ON SO AMAZING ARE ""NEW YORK TIMES"" WROTE AN ARTICLE, BUT THEY DON'T CARE. IT'S SO DISHONEST, THEY HAVE POISONED THE MINDS OF THE VOTERS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM, I THINK THE VOTERS ARE SEEING THROUGH IT. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO SEE THROUGH IT. WE'LL FIND OUT. >> BUT SIR -- IF YOU LOOK, EXCUSE ME, CHRIS. IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR VOTER ROLLS YOU WILL SEE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE, MILLIONS -- THIS ISN'T COMING FROM ME THIS IS COMING FROM A REPORT, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE THAT SHOULDN'T BE REGISTERED TO VOTE. LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE OTHER THING. I TALK ABOUT THE CORRUPT MEDIA, THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, TELL YOU ONE OTHER THING. SHE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO RUN. IT'S CROOKED. SHE'S GUILTY OF VERY SERIOUS CRIME. SHE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO RUN. AND JUST IN THAT RESPECT I SAY IT'S RIGGED. BECAUSE SHE SHOULD NEVER -- CHRIS, SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY BASED ON WHAT SHE DID WITH E-MAILS AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS. >> BUT SIR THERE IS TRADITION IN THIS COUNTRY IN FACT ONE OF THE PRIDES OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER AND THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD FOUGHT A CAMPAIGN IS THAT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER, NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE LOSER OR THE WINNER. BUILT THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER AND THAT THE COUNTRY COMES TOGETHER IN PART FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE NOT PREPARED NOW TO -- >> WHAT I'M SAYING THAT I WILL TELL YOU AT THE TIME. I'LL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE. >> WELL, CHRIS, LET ME RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S HORRIFYING. EVERY TIME DONALD THINKS THINGS ARE NOT GOING IN HIS DIRECTION HE CLAIMS WHATEVER IT IS IS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. THE FBI CONDUCTED A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION INTO MY E-MAILS, THEY CONCLUDED THERE WAS NO CASE. HE SAID THE FBI WAS RIGGED. HE LOST THE IOWA CAUCUS, THE WISCONSIN PRIMARY, HE SAID THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY WAS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. THEN TRUMP UNIVERSITY GETS SUED FOR FRAUD AND RACKETEERING, HE CLAIMS THE COURT SYSTEM AND THE FEDERAL JUDGE IS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. THERE WAS EVEN A TIME WHEN HE DIDN'T GET AN EMMY FOR HIS TV PROGRAM THREE YEARS IN A ROW HE STARTED TWEETING THAT THE EMMYS WERE RIGGED -- >> SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT. >> THIS IS A MINDSET. THIS IS HOW DONALD THINKS. AND IT'S FUNNY, BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY TROUBLING. THAT IS NOT THE WAY OUR DEMOCRACY WORKS. WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR 240 YEARS. WE'VE HAD FAIRY PLEX, EVE ELECTED THE OUTCOMES WHEN WE MAY NOT HAVE LIKED THEM. AND THAT IS WHAT MUST BE EXPECTED OF ANYONE STANDING ON A DEBATE STAGE DURING A GENERAL ELECTION. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU'RE WHINING -- >> HOLD ON FOLKS. >> IT JUST SHOWS YOU'RE NOT UP TO DOING THE JOB. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE IS SAYING WHAT THAT MEANS. HE IS DENIGRATING TALKING DOWN OUR DEMOCRACY I FOR ONE AM APPALLED THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS"
