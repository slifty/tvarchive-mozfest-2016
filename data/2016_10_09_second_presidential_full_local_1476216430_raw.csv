SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT HIM OFF AND SHE SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, LAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED. KATHY SHELTON, THAT YOUNG WOMAN, IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT. SO, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WORDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY, I APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAY. BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID, HE WAS IMPEACHED, HE LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN. PAULA JONES, WHO IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN HILLARY BRINGS UP A POINT LIKE THAT SHE TALKS ABOUT WORDS THAT I SAID 11 YEARS AGO, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK SHE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

TRUMP. >> THEY'RE TAKING OUR WEALTH THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. >> SECRETARY CLINTON DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND? >> WELL, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING OVER THE LAST 48 HOURS ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW. YOU KNOW, WITH PRIOR REPUBLICAN NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENT, I DISAGREED WITH THEM. ON POLITICS, POLICIES, PRINCIPLE, BUT I NEVER QUESTIONED THEIR FITNESS TO SERVE. DONALD TRUMP IS DIFFERENT. I SAID STARTING BACK IN JUNE THAT HE WAS NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF. AND MANY REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS HAVE SAID THE SAME THING. WHAT WE ALL SAW AND HEARD ON FRIDAY WAS DONALD TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN. AND HE HAS SAID THAT THE VIDEO DOESN'T REPRESENT WHO HE IS."

ONE LINE IN PARTICULAR IN WHICH YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON, REPORTEDLY SAID YOU NEED BOTH A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POSITION ON CERTAIN ISSUES. SO, TWO, FROM VIRGINIA, ASKEDS IT OKAY FOR POLITICIANS TO BE TWO-FACED? IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A PRIVATE STANCE ON ISSUES. SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, RIGHT, AS I RECALL THAT WAS SOMETHING I SAID ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN AFTER HAVING SEEN THE WONDERFUL STEVEN SPIELBERG MOVIE CALLED ""LINCOLN."" IT WAS A MASTER CLASS WATCHING PRESIDENT LINCOLN GET THE CONGRESS TO APPROVE THE 13th AMENDMENT. IT WAS PRINCIPLED, IT WAS STRATEGIC. AND I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT IT IS HARD SOMETIMES TO GET THE CONGRESS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE HE USED SOME ARGUMENTS, CONVINCING OTHER PEOPLE, HE USED OTHER ARGUMENTS, THAT WAS A GREAT -- I THOUGHT A GREAT DISPLAY OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. BUT, YOU KNOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE, MARTHA, BECAUSE OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY JUST CAME OUT AND SAID IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, THAT THE KREMLIN, MEANING PUTIN AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, ARE DIRECTING THE ATTACKS, THE HACKING ON AMERICAN ACCOUNTS TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. AND WIKILEAKS IS PART OF THAT, AS ARE OTHER SITES WHERE THE RUSSIANS HACK INFORMATION, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S ACCURATE INFORMATION, THEN THEY PUT IT OUT. WE HAVE NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE AN ADVERSARY, A FOREIGN POWER, IS WORKING SO HARD TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. AND BELIEVE ME, THEY'RE NOT DOING IT TO GET ME ELECTED. THEY'RE DOING IT TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION FOR DONALD TRUMP. NOW, MAYBE BECAUSE HE HAS PRAISED PUTIN, MAYBE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE AGREES WITH A LOT OF WHAT PUTIN WANTS TO DO, MAYBE BECAUSE HE WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN MOSCOW, I DON'T KNOW THE REASONS. BUT WE DESERVE ANSWERS. AND WE SHOULD DEMAND THAT DONALD RELEASE ALL OF HIS TAX RETURNS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT ARE THE INTANGLEMENTS AND -- >> WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER. SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU'RE OUT OF TIME. >> I THINK SHY RESPOND BECAUSE -- SHY RESPOND SO RIDICULOUS. NOW SHE'S BLAMING -- SHE GOT CAUGHT IN A TOTAL LIE. HER PAPERS WENT OUT TO ALL HER FRIENDS AT THE BANK, GOLDMAN SACHS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. AND SHE SAID THINGS WIKILEAKS THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED.

""NEW YORK TIMES"" PUBLISHED THREE PAGES OF YOUR 1995 TAX RETURN, SHOW YOU CLAIMED $960 MILLION LOSS. WHICH MEANS YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED PAYING PERSONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES FOR YEARS, WE'VE SAID YOU PAY STATE TAXES, REAL ESTATE TAXES, PROPERTY TAXES, YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THOUGH SIMPLE QUESTION, DID YOU USE THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO AVOID PAYING PERSONAL FED RAM INCOME TAX. >> OF COURSE I DO. SO DO ALL OF HER DONORS OR MOST OF HER DONORS. I KNOW MANY OF HER DONORS. THEY TOOK MASSIVE TAX WRITE-OFFS. >> HAVE YOU -- LOT OF MY WRITE OFF WAS DEPRECIATION AND OTHER THINGS THAT HILLARY AS SENATOR ALLOWED. SHE'LL ALWAYS ALLOW PEOPLE THAT GIVE HER ALL THIS MONEY THEY WANT IT. THAT'S WHY. SEE I UNDERSTAND THE TAX CODE BETTER THAN ANYBODY THAT'S EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HILLARY CLINTON AND IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLEX, HILLARY CLINTON HAS FRIENDS THAT WANT ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDING THEY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO WALL STREET PEOPLE. BUT THEY REALLY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION. WHICH I BELIEVE HILLARY'S LEAVING, VERY INTERESTING WHY SHE'S LEAVING CARRIED INTEREST.

IT WAS A MASTER CLASS WATCHING PRESIDENT LINCOLN GET THE CONGRESS TO APPROVE THE 13th AMENDMENT. IT WAS PRINCIPLED, IT WAS STRATEGIC. AND I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT IT IS HARD SOMETIMES TO GET THE CONGRESS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE HE USED SOME ARGUMENTS, CONVINCING OTHER PEOPLE, HE USED OTHER ARGUMENTS, THAT WAS A GREAT -- I THOUGHT A GREAT DISPLAY OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. BUT, YOU KNOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE, MARTHA, BECAUSE OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY JUST CAME OUT AND SAID IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, THAT THE KREMLIN, MEANING PUTIN AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, ARE DIRECTING THE ATTACKS, THE HACKING ON AMERICAN ACCOUNTS TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. AND WIKILEAKS IS PART OF THAT, AS ARE OTHER SITES WHERE THE RUSSIANS HACK INFORMATION, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S ACCURATE INFORMATION, THEN THEY PUT IT OUT. WE HAVE NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE AN ADVERSARY, A FOREIGN POWER, IS WORKING SO HARD TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION.

NOW, MAYBE BECAUSE HE HAS PRAISED PUTIN, MAYBE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE AGREES WITH A LOT OF WHAT PUTIN WANTS TO DO, MAYBE BECAUSE HE WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN MOSCOW, I DON'T KNOW THE REASONS.
