# About the Data
This data was generated by the Internet Archive's [Duplitron 5000 (DT5k)](https://github.com/slifty/tvarchive-duplitron)
as part of a special project within the [Political Ad Archive](politicaladarchive.org/debate-project).

The DT5k uses an audio fingerprinting library called Audfprint to compare different
pieces of audio and video.  The resulting matches were then packaged into the csvs
you see in this directory
